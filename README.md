# mongo-db-raplication-cross-platform
This script manages MongoDB replication on Ubuntu/Linux, macOS, and Windows. It modifies the MongoDB config file for replica set setup, ensuring compatibility across platforms. It reads variables from a .env file, backs up the config, and restarts the MongoDB service. When enabled, it initiates the replica set and handles changes smoothly.
